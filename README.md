# TuneGen: Emotion-Based Spotify Playlist Recommendation System

TuneGen is an innovative web application that recommends Spotify playlists based on the user's detected emotions using real-time facial recognition and emotion analysis.

## Features

- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Uses your webcam to capture facial expressions and detect emotions.
- **Emotion-Based Playlist Recommendations**: Recommends Spotify playlists that match the detected emotions.
- **Interface**: Simple and user-friendly web interface.

## How It Works

1. **Capture Facial Expressions**: The webcam captures real-time video of the user's face.
2. **Emotion Detection**: The captured frames are processed to detect faces and predict the user's emotion using a pre-trained deep learning model.
3. **Playlist Recommendation**: Based on the detected emotion, the system recommends a Spotify playlist that matches the user's current emotional state.

## Models and Technologies Used

- **Face Detection**: Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.
- **Emotion Detection**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on facial expression data.
- **Web Framework**: Flask for the web application.
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV for capturing and processing video frames.
- **Deep Learning**: Keras with TensorFlow backend for loading and predicting emotions using the pre-trained model.

## Update Model and Haarcascade Paths

Ensure the paths for the model and Haarcascade XML file in app.py are correct based on your project structure:

- face_classifier = cv2.CascadeClassifier('path/to/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
- classifier = load_model('path/to/model.h5')

## Add Your Spotify Playlists

Replace the placeholder Spotify playlist URLs in the playlistmanager function in app.py with your own Spotify premium playlist URLs.

## Running the Application
  1. **Run the Flask Application**: python app.py
  2. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Required Libraries

Flask, OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, Numpy

### Models

  1. **Face Detection Model:** Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in the video frames.
  2. **Emotion Detection Model:** A deep learning model built with Keras, pre-trained on a dataset of facial expressions to recognize emotions such as Angry, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.
